# Draw and Guess

This is a simple 'Pictionary' style game. Users begin by choosing a name and room.
A word is broadcast to one player in the room and they must draw it while the other players try to guess what it is.
Once someone guesses correctly, the next person in the room is given a new word and a new round start.
